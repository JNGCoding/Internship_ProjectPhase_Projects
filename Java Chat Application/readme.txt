For creating the Java Chat Application,
I decided to seperate the Server code and Client code in seperate projects.
"capp_server" contains the Server code and "capp" contains the Client Code.
both can be compiled with maven or with the java extension that comes for VSCode.
.jar files can be found in the out file.
